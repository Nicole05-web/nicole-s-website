  <h2>ABOUT THE PROGRAM</h2>
  <div class="description">
      <p>The "feminine Warriors Internship Program was created by Ms Nicole Thandeka Moyo in 2013, she had a vision that if more girls were in the army, that would combat social stigmas that are towards jobs that are gender assigned.<br>
      Women are just as capable, with dedication and determination,  regardless of what people say. Ms Moyo believed that women were not motivated enough to take up certain careers and this is why she came up with this program, to motivate and encourage women.This is a  six month program including intensified military training with the support from the SANDF. <i><br> "Social stigmas are only there to bring you down, telling you what you can and cannot do, your abilities are stored deep in you, its the drive, the passion, so take your shot and remember if he can do it so can you."</i>-Ms Nicole Moyo <br>

       <h2>JUST TO KNOW</h2>
       <P>
       <i> “Doubt is a killer. You just have to know who you are and what you stand for.”. – Jennifer Lopez.</i> <br>
      Never doubt yourself because you have never given it a try, women have been in the shadows, in businesses , in the military,in engineering and all those other "men" perceived industries. Those are all careers that are assigned to a specific gender and gender should't define who we are. <br> 
        You should always know that you are capable, you are stong and not even the sky is your limit. Confidence is unbreakable only if you truly believe in yourself. Wake up every day with a positive mindset and remember THE WORLD IS YOUR PLAYGROUND. <br>
